Hello lovely ladies,

I hope you are all well.

Our darling friend â€¦ is getting married. And what better way to send her into married life than with an awesome She-ra themed hen party!

The bride would love to have you with her to celebrate this very big time in her life.

As you see, there is a link at the bottom of this email. This will take you to the Hen Party App, were you will be asked to complete a form specifying when you are free and your budget.

This will help me get the wheels in motion.

I look forward to getting your feedback.

All the best,

Chief Hen
