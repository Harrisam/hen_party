Would you be my maid of honour?
-------------------------------

Samantha is very exicited to be her friend's maid of honour. However,
organising 15 girls on a weekend away with their many competing ideas
and suggestions was not an easy task. So we got together to create an app
to make her job easier.


Collaboration
-------------

We used agile to focus our efforts and prioritise the core features needed
for this MVP. After 10 days we presented the app to over 100 people at the
[Makers Academy] graduation on Friday 8 November 2013.

For the duration of the project Jodie had to work from home in Cardiff,
whilst Samantha and Josh worked in London. We only had one session together
with a whiteboard.
